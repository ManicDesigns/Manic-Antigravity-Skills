[Buy API Field Filters](ref-buy-browse-filters.html)

Many of the Buy APIs are a  [![Limited Release](/cms/img/docs/partners-api.svg "Limited Release")(Limited Release)](/api-docs/static/versioning.html#Limited). The use of eBay’s Buy APIs in production is intended for eBay partners only. You must [apply for production access](/api-docs/buy/static/buy-requirements.html#Applying) through the eBay Partner Network. Acceptance of applications is based on the proposed business model, as well as a formal agreement to abide by the policies and requirements stipulated by eBay.

**Note:** There is no guarantee that your application for production use of the APIs will be approved.

## Using the APIs in sandbox

Anyone with an eBay developer account can use the Buy APIs in the sandbox with the exception of methods in the **guest\_checkout\_session** and **checkout\_session** resources which are those methods used for **guest checkout** and **eBay member checkout**, respectively.

Developers who require access to **guest checkout**/**eBay member checkout** methods should reach out to Developer Technical Support (DTS) and/or their Business Unit contact to request approval. Once approved for production use of the Buy APIs for **guest checkout** and/or **eBay member checkout** use cases, developers will then be granted access to use the **guest checkout** and/or **eBay member checkout** methods in the sandbox as well.

We advise you to complete the [Production application process](#Applying) and obtain approval before you invest significantly in application development and testing.

## Beta launch phase

Some of the eBay Buy APIs are currently beta releases. This means that they are subject to change and consumers may be asked to update their integration accordingly, depending upon the nature of the change. For details about the implications of different phases of eBay API releases, see [API launch stages](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/versioning.html#API) in the Using eBay RESTful APIs guide.

## Production eligibility requirements

Users must meet standard eligibility requirements, get approvals from eBay support organizations, and sign contracts with eBay to access the Buy APIs in production. Meeting the standard eligibility requirements is not a guarantee that production access will be granted.
See [Production access process](#Applying) for additional information and instructions for requesting production access.

These requirements are grouped into:

* [Contractual requirements](#Contract)
* [Technical requirements](#Technica)
* [Application requirements for checkout](#reqckout)
* [User experience requirements for eBay guest checkouts](#User)
* [Guest checkout flow requirements](#User2)

### Contractual requirements

Use of the eBay APIs in production requires the following accounts:

* An eBay member account (on [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/)) (This is required in order to use sandbox.)
* An [eBay Developers Program account](https://developer.ebay.com/join/) (This is required in order to use sandbox.)

In addition to all the contracts and agreements associated with the accounts, such as the [eBay User Agreement](https://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement.html), the [API License Agreement](/join/api-license-agreement), and the [eBay Partner Network Agreement](https://partnernetwork.ebay.com/legal#network-agreement), there are contracts with eBay that are specific to the eBay Buy APIs and your business model. You may also be required to sign Mutual Non-disclosure Agreements (MNDAs) depending on your business model. Also, if you want to download the item feed files or get paid for selling eBay items, you need to become an affiliate by joining the [eBay Partner Network](https://partnernetwork.ebay.com/). For additional information, see [Affiliate Marketing Resources](https://partnernetwork.ebay.com/our-program/what-is-affiliate-marketing/).

### Technical requirements

Depending on your use case, your application must meet one or both of the following requirements:

* Application must be fully functional and reviewable on the eBay sandbox
* Application must implement affiliate tracking details (needed for revenue share capability)

### Application requirements for checkout

There are two types of checkouts:

* The **member** method of the Order API. This is for eBay members who are signed in.
* The **Checkout with eBay** widget flow. This is for eBay guests, who are anonymous.

The following describes the requirements for these checkout types.

#### Application requirements for eBay member checkout (Order API)

To use the [checkout\_session](/api-docs/buy/order_v1/resources/methods) resource, which supports eBay member checkout, you need approval. This approval will give you access for member checkout in both the sandbox and production API environments. To request approval, see [Production access process](#Applying).

The requirements for using eBay member checkout will be communicated to you with your access approval. They will be similar to the requirements for
the [Application requirements for eBay guest checkouts](#Guest). However, there could be additional requirements, and some guest checkout requirements may not apply.

#### Application requirements for eBay guest checkouts (Checkout with eBay)

The **guest\_checkout\_session** resource lets eBay guests purchase items using the [Checkout with eBay widget](api-order.html#psb-checkout). This lets eBay guests purchase items by credit card, direct debit, or other payment method.

Partners **must** include the following data elements within the commerce flow and adhere to all user experience requirements detailed in the tables below.

### User experience requirements for eBay guest checkouts

The following sections list the requirements for the browse, view item, partner cart and checkout experiences by marketplace. For a list of marketplaces supported by the Buy APIs, see
[Buy API Support by Marketplace](/api-docs/buy/static/ref-marketplace-supported.html).

**Note:** The following user experience requirements apply to all guest checkouts, except where noted.

#### User experience guest checkout item requirements

The following table lists the browse/search requirements for items in all marketplaces.

|  | Fields Returned by Browse and Feed APIs |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed Price Items | **Required:** Only surface FIXED PRICE items **Browse** and **Feed** APIs: filter `buyingOptions` for `FIXED_PRICE` |
| Sort browse | **Prohibited:** Disabling eBay's sort functionality. Partners and users are *not* permitted to sort items. **Note:** The data provided is already sorted to present the most relevant/best match according to eBay's algorithms; further sorting would produce a sub-optimal experience. |
| Free Shipping | **Recommended:** Surface only items offering free shipping **Browse** API: filter `maxDeliveryCost` for `0` |
| Delivery Country | **Required:** Filter delivery country for domestic market  You can sell only items that are delivered within the same country as the marketplace of the item. For example, if the marketplace is EBAY\_DE you can sell only items delivered in Germany.  **Browse** API: filter `deliveryCountry` **Feed** API: filter `shipToIncludedRegions` |

#### User experience guest checkout view item and Partner's cart pages

The following table lists the information required on the View Item and Partner's Cart pages in all marketplaces supported by the
Order API.
